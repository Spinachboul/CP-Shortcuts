# DSA

This is a **Data Structures and Algorithms** curated repository where I would be adding various DSA problems which would be medium - hard and also some **Competitive Programming** problems 
(Codeforces & Leetcode) and templates which anyone could use for their benefit

My codeforces Profile: https://codeforces.com/profile/freebie <br>
My Leetcode Profile: https://leetcode.com/u/EasyPlay/

I have just started doing Competitive Programming and I request everyone to hit this repository with a PR if you find any medium-hard question on the platform.

The best CP reference websites: https://cp-algorithms.com/ <br>
